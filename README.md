In this experiment we are going to imagine we have three people, Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice has a state $|\Psi \rangle$ that she wants to send to Bob. In order to help send her state, Charlie provides Alice and Bob each with an entangled pair of qubits. In the experiement, Alice initially has qubit $Q_0$ (this qubit is in the state $|\Psi\rangle$ that she wants to send Bob), and Charlie distributes $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ to Alice and Bob respectively. 

Using teleportation we can show the state $|\Psi \rangle$ (which is stored on Alice's Qubit $Q_0$) is teleported from qubit $Q_0$ to qubit $Q_2$ on the same circuit. Unlike a swap operation, $Q_2$ and $Q_0$ never have a quantum gate directly connecting them - the only information transfered are two classical bits through the $C_0$ and $C_1$ registers.
